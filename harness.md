A typical wire harness assembly can include:

* Affixing wires, sub-assemblies, and other components directly to a pinboard.
* Navigating all of these components through the necessary cable sleeves for added strength and protection.
* Make sure any cable ties, cable wraps, or other infrastructure is secured and in its right place, paying particular attention to critical branch-out locations.
* Utilizing automated, semi-automated, or even hand crimping tools for wires especially when we have multiple wires into single terminals.

With semi-automated capabilities, alongside our production team’s highly-skilled use of hand tools, we’re able to blend technology and fine work craft in a single, perfect package. Hand tools are still quite necessary, even in our state-of-the-art production facilities, in order to pull off a successful project.

Wire Harness Design Starts with the Right Components

Wire harnesses are able to facilitate the manufacture of larger systems by providing the critical connections needed in a “plug and play” install. But don’t let that name fool you, while there are universal wiring harnesses, these are often generic solutions that may check some, but not all of the boxes required in a unique application. Our cable harness design engineers work hard to create the perfect amalgamation of conductors, wrapping, sheathing, connectors, strain reliefs, grommets, and all other components required.

In addition to the perfect materials, we also have to take into account the intended environment. Protecting against abrasion, caustic chemicals, moisture, dust, interference, and any number of additional environmental variables is absolutely crucial for ensuring long-term operability.




Custom Wire Harnesses Proof Points

We offer such highly-customizable features with each and every wire harness we produce such as:

    Conductor Sizes
    Stranding Sizes
    Connector Housing Material/Ratings
    Conductor Colors
    Wire Jacket Materials
