Whether it be a peer review of your design documentation or a turnkey development for your next product, we have the resources to support your needs. We work with local engineering, fabricators and assembly shops as needed for development and short run manufacturing, we work with off shore companies when needed for low cost manufacturing efforts, and we provide support for your contract manufacturer to make sure your product launch is smooth.  We look forward to working with you!

We are fully equipped to take your requirements supporting schematic capture, PCBA layout, component selection, feature implementation, DFM analysis, automated testing, or even redesign of legacy products to support supply chain flexability.  We can even build and fabricate prototype quantities of the design in house.  This keeps our cost low, assembly times short, and gets solutions to your door faster.  This  allows us to validate the system in real--world conditions before engaging in a full production run.

Most boards can be built in a day, as opposed to several weeks and tooling charges that are necessary when using a dedicated assembly house.

We also are able to support most electrical compliance testing, including UL, FCC, CE and more!  Leverage our excellent network of contacts in the testing and compliance industry.  Not only will your design be compliant with the certifying body you seek to use, but we can manage the process along the way and get certified quickly.
