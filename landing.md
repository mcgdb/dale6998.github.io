			<h2>Who We Are</h2>
		</header>
		<p>
BubblesTech is an electrical/firmware engineering company that offers a wide range of electrical and firmware engineering, design, and consulting services. Our engineering team are experts in the industry who bring dedicated professional expertise to our partnerships, and our projects.

We are also capable of multiple kinds of delivery methods ranging from traditional design-bid-build, design-assist, design-build, integrated project delivery, and construction-manager-at-risk (CMAR). Our staff of firmware and electrical engineers, electrical design consultants, and assembly technicians give us the versatility to move in any direction and make us one of the top electrical engineering firms in the US.

Time is money, and no one appreciates that as much as early and mid stage businesses.  We know all too well that traditional paradigms of concept-to-consumer design cycles are slow, and costly.  We have the equipment and expertise in house to be quick, accurate and flexible to your projects needs.  We will get the design finished on time and on budget, and you get to keep the arm and the leg.
